## What is Time Series Data?

- Tracks change over time, records have a timestamp and observations
- Stock price, CPU and memory usage, sensor data, ad views, COVID-19
- Can be captured at regular intervals (metrics) or irregular intervals (events)
- Immutability, ordered, append-only (INSERTs)
- Events whose value increases when you add time field (example: logins)
- Uses: pattern recognition, forecasting (trends, seasonality), anomaly detection

## Why it is important?

- 260% higher insert performance, up to 54x faster queries, and simpler implementation when using TimeScaleDB vs MongoDB for time-series data.
- Better Data Model, Query Language, and Reliability
